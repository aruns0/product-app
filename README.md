# README

This is my first project using React library.As part of learning I have referenced youtube videoes,Stack overflow and several technical blogs written by experienced React developers.I tried my level best to include the best practices in a short span of time. Still a lot more to improve.

### -------------- Best Practices followed --------------

### Seperation of Concerns

Implemented seperation of concerns for handling authentication and logging.

### Services

Application specific services are included in the service layer.

### Test Driven Development

Test driven development approach is used for developing the application.

### Configuraion Management

Configurations are managed in an env file to reduce the application dependency.

### Security

Token based authentication is implemented.

### State Management

Redux is used for managing the states.

### Responsive design

Bootstrap is used for the design.

### -------------Instruction for setting up the application ----------------

- Clone the project

$ git clone https://github.com/aruns0/product-app.git

- Install dependencies

  $ npm install

- Run the test cases

  $ npm test

- Run the Server

  $ npm start

- Url

$ http://localhost:3001/

### -------------Features---------------

- List products

- Filter products based on brand

- Pagination

- Search products based on name (global search)

- Sort products based on price

- Product Details page

### --------------------TODO--------------------------

- Improve the code quality by learning best practices in react .
- Improve the error handling.
- Improve logging mechanism.
- Improve the UI design.
- Add more plugins like refux-thunk,enzyme,redux-auth etc.
- Include more test cases to extend the code coverage.
- Regression testing and bug fixing.
